# Amadeus-Writer
### *Work in progress*

  This project aims to be a multifunctional desktop application for fiction writers (or writers in general).
  
  My vision is to have a program that can be utilized in every step of the writing process, incluing the research, the outline, the writing itself, keeping track of characters, locations, items, etc. I plan to add tools such as a drawing board for sketching your own drawings, an integraded video player, a built-in Google extension, a timeline and more. It will take a while since I'm currently very busy.
  
  For now, you can already create characters and locations, specifying lots of attributes in each of them, you can use the famous corkboard for outlining, creating notes, changing colors, adding images, connecting stuff around... You can create chapters and write in each of them, changing the font weight and style, keep track of the characters and locations present in the chapter, add notes to it (which can be green or red, you can change the color anytime). There is a save option to save all of these components and the chapter writing has an autosave function, including word count.
  
## Contribute to the project
  
  This is my first real public project, so I'm fairly new to GitHub. If you're a developer, feel free to contact me or just open Pull Requests and that'll be much appreciated. If you're a writer, you can download the application and test it's current features, leaving some feedback in the "Issues" section on suggestion of new features or improvement of existing ones.
  
## Where to get it

  For now you can download the executable from the Release folder and simply run it, it should run on all Windows devices (Mac and Linux builds will come soon). Beware of the fact that the program is very far from finished and you should *not* use it for writing yet, as there is no export option yet, so everything you write in each chapter will be saved but be enssentialy useless (unless you copy them somewhere else manually, but that will result in the loss of bold, italic and underline decorations).

  Note that if you do test it out, your antivirus may block it from saving, as that requires writing data to your computer such as folders, images and files. To overcome that you'll have to figure out a way to prevent your antivirus from blocking it.
